# ciphertext
Cipher text encryption and decryption . Each character in C (like 'A', 'B', 'C', etc.) has a corresponding numeric value called the ASCII value. When you subtract 'A' from another letter, you're essentially shifting the ASCII value of the letter to a "range" that starts at 0 for 'A', 1 for 'B', and so on.
